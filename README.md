# Small Project for a Limousine Rental Company

This is a README file for a [limousine rental site](http://aselectivelimo.com) I am working on.

My goal is to help renters all over the city to find the best limousine rental company available.
It is actually not cheap to rent a limousine which is why you need to ensure the quality of the service
you're getting before you sign the contract. Luckily, there are many limousine rental company to choose
from. The problem is finding the right one for the job.

For many potential renters of limousine, it is important that you learn to identify good qualities from
bad ones. Once you know these qualities, you can easily identify good companies from bad ones.
Identifying the good companies would let you get more from your money.

## Here are the qualityies you need to look out for

* Reputation

* Years of service

* Skills/Experience

* Price

* Freebies

* Flexibility

I understand that there are more qualities that I did not put it here. I only list the most important once.
If you want to add more qualities to this list, that is your prerogative. It's just that this list would
suffice most of the time.

You can even use this list for your other company hunting endeavor. The first thing you need to look
into is their reputation. If their reputation is good, you should hear mostly good things about them.
Of course, there will be some bad reviews here and there but the majority of the review should be
positive.

## Importance of price

Price shouldn't really be your concern when renting a limousine. Sure, you would still consider this quality
but it shouldn't be your main concern. It should come after the reputation and the experience of the
company because that is more important.

You should spend a little bit more if you know that what you're getting is more than your money's worth.
